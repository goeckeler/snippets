# JRobots Racing Car Competition

This is my racing car called "Baldies" for the JRobots Racing Car Competition in December 2016. If you unpack the runtime environment, you only need to put this racer into the `src` folder so you can actually select it.

Keep in mind, it was written in 15 minutes to complete the field.
